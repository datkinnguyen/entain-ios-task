# Claude Instructions for Neds Task Project

## Session Initialisation

When starting a new session for this project, automatically load and read the following files to understand the project context:

1. **README.md** - Project overview, requirements, and setup instructions
2. **Documentation/CODING_GUIDELINES.md** - All coding conventions, best practices, and rules

These files provide essential context about the project goals, architecture, and implementation approach.

## Important Rules

### Coding Conventions

**ALL coding conventions, best practices, and development rules MUST be documented in Documentation/CODING_GUIDELINES.md.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Code style and formatting
- Architecture patterns
- Localization practices
- Accessibility guidelines
- Testing conventions
- Security practices

Do NOT add coding guidelines to this file (CLAUDE.md). CLAUDE.md is only for session initialisation and project-specific instructions for Claude.
